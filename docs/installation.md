Installing the module is rather simple. The only file that's needed for the actual BitBuffer is [the main one](https://github.com/Dekkonot/bitbuffer/blob/main/src/vanilla.lua). Copy the contents of that file to a Lua file if you're using vanilla Lua or a ModuleScript if you're using Roblox, and it's ready to go.

## For Roblox users

The roblox version of the module is stored in [`roblox.lua`](https://github.com/Dekkonot/bitbuffer/blob/main/src/roblox.lua). If you're using Roblox, you should probably use the files there. The Roblox version makes use of `table.create` and will eventually have type annotations. A few [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) files are provided in the repository for convenience.
